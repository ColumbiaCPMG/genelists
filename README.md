# Genelists compiled from various sources that can be used for geneset analysis in denovo or gene burden analysis

The gene lists in this repository is separated into constrained and not constrained genes. Within the constrained and not constrained genes folder, please find the genes classified by three types of deleterious variants: 
1. Missense
2. PTV
3. PTV and Missense 
Within these subfolders is another subfolder that contains gene lists that exclude kidney genes. 

The gene list for autism-associated genes is obtained from the public database AutDb, which is explained in detail in the associated paper, "AutDB: a gene reference resource for autism research" (Basu, Saumyendra N et al. “AutDB: a gene reference resource for autism research.” Nucleic acids research vol. 37,Database issue (2009): D832-6. doi:10.1093/nar/gkn835). The AutDB database contains monogenic genes as well as risk-conferring candidates of autism. Genes from this database were identified through extensive literature review of published scientific literature within the PubMed database and then annotated–a step which includes a classification of the candidate gene into one or more of the following categories:   
1. rAut: genes associated with rare, monogenic ASD
2. sAut: gnees associated with syndromic ASD
3. iAut: genes associated with idiopathic ASD
4. fAut: functional candidates that do ot fall into rAut, sAut or iAut categories. 

The gene list for congenital heart disease (CHD) is obtained from the article, "Contribution of rare inherited and de novo variants in 2,871 congenital heart disease probands" (Jin, Sheng Chih et al. “Contribution of rare inherited and de novo variants in 2,871 congenital heart disease probands.” Nature genetics vol. 49,11 (2017): 1593-1601. doi:10.1038/ng.3970). The paper conducted whole-exome sequencing 2,871 CHD probands from the PCGC and Pediatric Heart Network (PHN) programs. They filtered out individuals who had trisomies and CHD-associated CNVs. A control cohort of 1,789 individuals of unaffected parents and siblings of autism probands was used in analysis.
